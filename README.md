# LeetCode

Made this repository with the intention of improving my coding in terms of interviews. While solving these problems/algorithms within the folders, my main intention was to maximize space / time complexity, as well as to finish the solutions as quickly as possible.

All code is my own, and each algorithm passes all test cases to the corresponding problem on LeetCode. Feel free to use/reference.
